<h1>FitPulse Health Anomaly Detection from Fitness Devices Project</h1>
This is an internship project performed under the guidance of an Infosys Springboard mentor. This project uses Python libraries for effective data science operations and generating data visualisations. 
The main repository contains this README.md file and the MIT License.
<h2>Milestone 1</h2>
This Milestone explores basic data preprocessing. It contains a data folder within which is placed the health_fitness_dataset.zip file (Since the dataset is huge, it is zipped) and a cleaned_health_fitness_data.csv file.<br>
Since the dataset is mainly a clean one, no major data cleaning is needed. Only two things are done:<br>
1. The 'health_condition' column is removed due to an abundance of null data.<br>
2. The type of 'date' column is converted from object to datetime.
